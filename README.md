# Make Bridge Examples and Documentation

This repository contains examples and documentation for Make Bridge, a tool developed by Make that enables seamless integration of automation capabilities into external applications and services. It acts as an abstraction layer between the Make platform and end users, allowing integrators (Make's Bridge customers) to embed Make's automation features into their own products without requiring end users to directly interact with the Make platform.

More information about Bridge can be found in the [Make Bridge: Introduction](./docs/bridge-introduction.md).

This repository further includes a guide on integrating Make Bridge into your application using the Bridge Portal. The Portal is a modular microservice designed to enhance the functionality of the Make platform by serving as a secure entry point for external applications to interact with Make's ecosystem. It provides a streamlined and secure way for integrators to embed Make's automation capabilities into their own products while maintaining control over user access and context. More information about Bridge Portal can be found in the [Make Bridge Portal: Introduction](./docs/portal-introduction.md).

Detailed instructions on integrating Make Bridge using the Bridge Portal can be found in the [Make Bridge Integration Guide](./docs/portal-guide.md).
